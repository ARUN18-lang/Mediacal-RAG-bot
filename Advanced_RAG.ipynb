Anatomy includes those structures that can be seen grossly (without the aid of magnification) and microscopically (with the aid of magnification). Typically, when used by itself, the term anatomy tends to mean gross or macroscopic anatomy—that is, the study of structures that can be seen without using a microscopic. Microscopic anatomy, also called histology, is the study of cells and tissues using a microscope. Anatomy forms the basis for the practice of medicine. Anatomy leads the physician toward an understanding of a patient’s disease, whether he or she is carrying out a physical examination or using the most advanced imaging techniques. Anatomy is also important for dentists, chiropractors, physical therapists, and all others involved in any aspect of patient treatment that begins with an analysis of clinical signs. The ability to interpret a clinical observation correctly is therefore the endpoint of a sound anatomical understanding. Anatomy_Gray. What is anatomy?

Anatomy is much more than just memorization of lists of names. Although the language of anatomy is important, the network of information needed to visualize the position of physical structures in a patient goes far beyond simple memorization. Knowing the names of the various branches of the external carotid artery is not the same as being able to visualize the course of the lingual artery from its origin in the neck to its termination in the tongue. Similarly, understanding the organization of the soft palate, how it is related to the oral and nasal cavities, and how it moves during swallowing is very different from being able to recite the names of its individual muscles and nerves.

How can gross anatomy be studied?': True, 'title: Anatomy_Gray\\nHow can gross anatomy be studied? The term anatomy is derived from the Greek word temnein, meaning “to cut.” Clearly, therefore, the study of anatomy is linked, at its root, to dissection, although dissection of cadavers by students is now augmented, or even in some cases replaced, by viewing prosected (previously dissected) material and plastic models, or using computer teaching modules and other learning aids. Anatomy can be studied following either a regional or a systemic approach. With a regional approach, each region of the body is studied separately and all aspects of that region are studied at the same time. For example, if the thorax is to be studied, all of its structures are examined. Anatomy_Gray. How can gross anatomy be studied?

After studying this region, the other regions of the body (i.e., the abdomen, pelvis, lower limb, upper limb, back, head, and neck) are studied in a similar fashion. In contrast, in a systemic approach, each system of the body is studied and followed throughout the entire body.

Testing touch in these autonomous zones in a conscious patient can be used to localize lesions to a specific spinal nerve or to a specific level in the spinal cord. Somatic motor nerves that were originally associated with a specific somite emerge from the anterior region of the spinal cord and, together with sensory nerves from the same level, become part of one spinal nerve. Therefore each spinal nerve carries somatic motor fibers to muscles that originally developed from the related somite.

Between the fracture margins a blood clot is formed into which new vessels grow. A jelly-like matrix is formed, and further migration of collagen-producing cells occurs. On this soft tissue framework, calcium hydroxyapatite is produced by osteoblasts and forms insoluble crystals, and then bone matrix is laid down. As more bone is produced, a callus can be demonstrated forming across the fracture site. Treatment of fractures requires a fracture line reduction.

The muscles lie posterolaterally to the vertebral column between the spinous processes medially and the angles of the ribs laterally. They are covered in the thoracic and lumbar regions by thoracolumbar fascia and the serratus posterior inferior, rhomboid, and splenius muscles. The mass arises from a broad, thick tendon attached to the sacrum, the spinous processes of the lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae, and the iliac crest (Fig. 2.50 and Table 2.4). It divides in the upper lumbar region into three vertical columns of muscle, each of which is further subdivided regionally (lumborum, thoracis, cervicis, and capitis), depending on where the muscles attach superiorly.': True, 'title: Anatomy_Gray\\nThe outer or most laterally placed column of the erector spinae muscles is the iliocostalis, which is associated with the costal elements and passes from the common tendon of origin to multiple insertions into the angles of the ribs and the transverse processes of the lower cervical vertebrae. The middle or intermediate column is the longissimus, which is the largest of the erector spinae subdivision extending from the common tendon of origin to the base of the skull. Throughout this vast expanse, the lateral positioning of the longissimus muscle is in the area of the transverse processes of the various vertebrae. The most medial muscle column is the spinalis, which is the smallest of the subdivisions and interconnects the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae. The spinalis is most constant in the thoracic region and is generally absent in the cervical region. It is associated with a deeper muscle (the semispinalis capitis) as the erector spinae group approaches the skull. Anatomy_Gray.

The anterior rami innervate most other skeletal muscles (the hypaxial muscles) of the body, including those of the limbs and trunk, and most remaining areas of the skin, except for certain regions of the head. Near the point of division into anterior and posterior rami, each spinal nerve gives rise to two to four small recurrent meningeal (sinuvertebral) nerves (see Fig. 2.59). These nerves reenter the intervertebral foramen to supply dura, ligaments, intervertebral discs, and blood vessels. All major somatic plexuses (cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral) are formed by anterior rami.': True, 'title: Anatomy_Gray\\nAll major somatic plexuses (cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral) are formed by anterior rami. Because the spinal cord is much shorter than the vertebral column, the roots of spinal nerves become longer and pass more obliquely from the cervical to coccygeal regions of the vertebral canal (Fig. 2.62). In adults, the spinal cord terminates at a level approximately between vertebrae LI and LII, but this can range between vertebra TXII and the disc between vertebrae LII and LIII. Consequently, posterior and anterior roots forming spinal nerves emerging between vertebrae in the lower regions of the vertebral column are connected to the spinal cord at higher vertebral levels. Below the end of the spinal cord, the posterior and anterior roots of lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal nerves pass inferiorly to reach their exit points from the vertebral canal. This terminal cluster of roots is the cauda equina. Nomenclature of spinal nerves Anatomy_Gray. All major somatic plexuses (cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral) are formed by anterior rami.

The first cervical nerve (C1) emerges from the vertebral canal between the skull and vertebra CI (Fig. 2.63). Therefore cervical nerves C2 to C7 also emerge from the vertebral canal above their respective vertebrae. Because there are only seven cervical vertebrae, C8 emerges between vertebrae CVII and TI.

The procedure is performed under sedation or light general anesthetic. Using X-ray guidance the pedicle is identified on the anteroposterior image. A metal cannula is placed through the pedicle into the vertebral body. Liquid bone cement is injected via the cannula into the vertebral body (Fig. 2.26). The function of the bone cement is two-fold. First, it increases the strength of the vertebral body and prevents further loss of height. Furthermore, as the bone cement sets, there is a degree of heat generated that is believed to disrupt pain nerve endings.

A true scoliosis involves not only the curvature (rightor left-sided) but also a rotational element of one vertebra upon another. The commonest types of scoliosis are those for which we have little understanding about how or why they occur and are termed idiopathic scoliosis. It is thought that there is some initial axial rotation of the vertebrae, which then alters the locations of the mechanical compressive and distractive forces applied through the vertebral growth plates, leading to changes in speed of bone growth and ultimately changes to spinal curvature.

One of the commonest abnormalities in the lumbar vertebrae is a partial fusion of vertebra LV with the sacrum (sacralization of the lumbar vertebra). Partial separation of vertebra SI from the sacrum (lumbarization of first sacral vertebra) may also occur (Fig. 2.29B). The LV vertebra can usually be identified by the iliolumbar ligament, which is a band of connective tissue that runs from the tip of the transverse process of LV to the iliac crest bilaterally (Fig. 2.29C).

In the clinic The vertebrae and cancer': True, 'title: Anatomy_Gray\\nA hemivertebra occurs when a vertebra develops only on one side (Fig. 2.29B). In the clinic The vertebrae and cancer The vertebrae are common sites for metastatic disease (secondary spread of cancer cells). When cancer cells grow within the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements, they interrupt normal bone cell turnover, leading to either bone destruction or formation and destroying the mechanical properties of the bone. A minor injury may therefore lead to vertebral collapse (Fig. 2.30A). Cancer cells have a much higher glucose metabolism compared with normal adjacent bone cells. These metastatic cancer cells can therefore be detected by administering radioisotope-labeled glucose to a patient and then tracing where the labeled glucose has been metabolized (Fig. 2.30B). Importantly, vertebrae that contain extensive metastatic disease may extrude fragments of tumor into the vertebral canal, compressing nerves and the spinal cord. In the clinic Anatomy_Gray.

There is a chronic inflammatory reaction in the walls of the arteries, with deposition of cholesterol and fatty proteins. This may in turn lead to secondary calcification, with reduction in the diameter of the vessels impeding distal flow. The plaque itself may be a site for attraction of platelets that may “fall off” (embolize) distally. Plaque fissuring may occur, which allows fresh clots to form and occlude the vessel. The importance of atherosclerosis and its effects depend upon which vessel is affected. If atherosclerosis occurs in the carotid artery, small emboli may form and produce a stroke. In the heart, plaque fissuring may produce an acute vessel thrombosis, producing a myocardial infarction (heart attack). In the legs, chronic narrowing of vessels may limit the ability of the patient to walk and ultimately cause distal ischemia and gangrene of the toes. In the clinic Anatomy_Gray.

When cancer cells grow within the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements, they interrupt normal bone cell turnover, leading to either bone destruction or formation and destroying the mechanical properties of the bone. A minor injury may therefore lead to vertebral collapse (Fig. 2.30A). Cancer cells have a much higher glucose metabolism compared with normal adjacent bone cells. These metastatic cancer cells can therefore be detected by administering radioisotope-labeled glucose to a patient and then tracing where the labeled glucose has been metabolized (Fig. 2.30B).

Thus even if this description does not appear at all after several hours use only its approximate dimension during training without considering whether those dimensions would need to change upon closer examination before using other techniques known to work correctly nowadays,[4][5](http://www...jwkppd_rndl9p1i6mq8vfz7xhzh0uQcDtGX+bHtwLNyCYZW40==)--this type might still cause difficulty while preparing your own book about anatomies.* Thereby increasing accuracy\n"
